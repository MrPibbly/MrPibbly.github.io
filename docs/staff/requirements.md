## 🌟 Be a Role Model

Staff are expected to lead by example. Here’s what that means:

💬 Always be friendly and respectful in chat  
🤝 Look for ways to bring players together and create a welcoming space  
🔇 If a player is being rude, **mute** them—don’t argue  
🚫 Do not use `/ignore` unless you have special permission (yes, we check!)  
🎭 Stay professional at all times  
🌐 Be kind *even outside* of Swyft—bad behavior in other communities can lead to removal

## ❤️ Respect Everyone

Swyft is for **everyone**, no matter their age.

🧒 **Younger players** may not understand everything right away. Help them!  
📘 Be patient if someone has trouble reading or using the wiki.  
🧓 **Older players** are welcome here too—Minecraft is for all generations!  
👤 Behind every username is a real person. Be kind, always.

## ✅ That’s It!
