# Moderator Position Guide

## Role Overview

As a Moderator, your primary responsibility is to ensure the safety, fairness, and enjoyment of our server community. This involves overseeing chat activity and player behavior in accordance with our server guidelines, and applying appropriate disciplinary actions when necessary.

Discretion is key when issuing punishments, with the goal of promoting player retention. Avoid excessive bans for minor infractions like chat spam or excessive profanityâ€”issue warnings first and reserve harsher penalties for repeat offenders.

For more serious violations, such as harassment, bullying, or malicious behavior, penalties should match the severity of the offense. While a warning may be sufficient in some cases, more severe conductâ€”such as the use of racial slursâ€”may warrant temporary bans. Use your judgment, and when appropriate, request an apology from the offending player before proceeding with further punishment.

## Player Interaction

Moderators must actively monitor the server to detect rule-breaking behavior, including actions not flagged by automated systems like Vulcan (e.g., X-ray usage). Use **Vanish** and **Spectator Mode** to observe players discreetly during official duties. These permissions are strictly for moderation purposesâ€”using them outside of your responsibilities may lead to disciplinary action or demotion. An exception is made if you are AFK in the designated **AFK Zone**.

When a player is caught violating rules:

1. Teleport them to your **Staff Office** using `/tphere`.
2. Conduct a private conversationâ€”the chat in the **Staff World** is hidden from other players.
3. Ask the player to explain their actions.
4. Based on the situation:
   - Issue a verbal or server warning using `/warn`
   - If the player ignores you or disconnects, apply immediate punishment.

## Disciplinary Tools

Maintaining a respectful and enjoyable environment requires proper use of the disciplinary tools available to moderators:

### ðŸ”‡ Mute

- Temporarily prevents a player from using chat.
- Use for instances such as spam, inappropriate language, or verbal abuse.
- Provides the player an opportunity to reflect on their behavior without being removed from the server.

### ðŸ‘¢ Kick

- Temporarily removes a player from the server.
- Indicates that their behavior is unacceptable while still allowing them a chance to rejoin and correct it.

### ðŸ”¨ Ban

- Reserved for severe or repeated violations.
- Temporarily or permanently removes a player from the server.
- Issued with caution, considering the overall impact on the community.

## Command & Rule Format

### Time Format 

```bash
s = seconds
m = minutes
h = hours
d = days
```

### Rule Format

When applying a rule to a punishment, use the correct format. For example, to mute a player for light spamming, use: Spamming 1.1(2)


### Command Usage

Add `-s` at the end of a command to issue it silently (hidden from regular players).

```bash
/warn MrPibbly <rule>
/mute MrPibbly <time> <rule>
/kick MrPibbly <time> <rule>
/ban MrPibbly <time> <rule>
```
