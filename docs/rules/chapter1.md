## 1 - Chat and Voice Chat Usage and Restrictions

The Swyft staff actively moderates all chats and reserves the right to enforce specific punishments, including the permanent removal of chat privileges. These moderation rules apply to both Minecraft Chat and any chat or voice channel within the Swyft server's Discord. 

> All edited or deleted messages are logged for reference. Ticket transcripts are stored and provided to the ticket initiator upon ticket closure. If you have disabled server DMs, you may request a transcript copy by opening a ticket and providing your ticket number. Transcript requests for previous transcript requests are not allowed.
