## 8 - Ticket System & Reporting

At Swyft, we highly value our **ticket system**, which allows staff members to manage and review player concerns effectively. If you feel you're not being appropriately helped or that the outcome is unfair, you may open a **Ticket Review**. Only senior staff and upper management have access to view these tickets.

- Once you open a **Ticket Review**, there is no need to continue communication in the original ticket. You may choose to close it, as staff can still view closed tickets.
- When you close a ticket, a **transcript** is automatically sent to you, which you can include in the **Ticket Review**.

### 8.1 - Ticket Abuse

To maintain the integrity of our ticket system and avoid spam, the following actions are prohibited:

- **Opening** and **immediately closing** a ticket.
- Continuously performing the above action to **spam** the ticket system.
- **Opening a ticket** under the wrong category (we understand mistakes happen—please notify us if this happens).
- **Spamming** or **harassing** staff members to get your ticket reviewed. Be patient; some issues take longer than others. If your ticket hasn't been replied to within **24 hours**, you may politely remind a staff member.

### 8.2 - False Evidence

Submitting **falsified or out-of-context evidence** can lead to consequences. If you submit false evidence unknowingly, you may appeal the punishment by providing proof that you did not realize the evidence was inaccurate. 

It’s recommended not to open a ticket on behalf of another player unless you are **certain** the evidence is correct.

### 8.3 - Ticket Review Abuse

The **Ticket Review** system is meant to ensure fair treatment. It should not be abused by repeatedly submitting **reviews** for the same issue because you disagree with the initial or final response.

> Please use the **Ticket Review** system responsibly and respect the process.
