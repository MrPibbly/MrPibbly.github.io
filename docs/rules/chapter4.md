## 4 - Cheating

Cheating is defined as **using any tools, modifications, or behaviors that provide an unfair advantage** over other players. This includes client modifications and exploiting game mechanics.

---

### 4.1 - Client-side Cheats (Hack Clients)

The use of client-side mods or hack clients to **gain an unfair advantage** is strictly prohibited. Examples include:

- X-Ray
- Auto-Clickers
- Speed Hacks
- Kill-Aura

> Check #Link-To-Guide-For-Allowed-Mods in Discord to see which mods are permitted.  
> Any mod not listed should be assumed **prohibited** by default.

If you believe a mod should be allowed, you may **submit a request** in Discord, and the mod will be reviewed by staff.

---

### 4.2 - Glitches, Bugs, and Exploits

If you discover a **glitch, bug, or exploit**, you are **required to report it** immediately by opening a **bug ticket** in Discord.

Abusing exploits will lead to disciplinary action. Swyft values fairness and fun, and exploit abuse disrupts the experience for everyone.
