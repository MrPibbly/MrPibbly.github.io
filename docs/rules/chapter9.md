## 9 - Land Claims and Management

We utilize the plugin **Lands** for our land claiming. By default, the plugin protects your land from modifications by players who are not a member of your land. You can assign permissions and roles to players. For more advanced features, please refer to the [Lands Wiki](#Link-To-Wiki).

### 9.1 - Land Rules

Owners and staff of **Lands** are allowed to create rules for the members of their land, as long as the rules are fair and do not break any server rules. **Punishment for breaking Land rules** will be handled by the staff of the respective Land. **Swyft staff** will not punish players for breaking Land-specific rules unless they are violating a server-wide rule.

### 9.2 - Griefing

To ensure players have a safe place to build and expand their land, **griefing** is not allowed. Members and non-members are prohibited from destroying any part of a land without the permission of the land owner.

If you buy or rent a piece of land, you must follow the rules in place for that land. For example, if you rent a shop in someone's mall and they have a rule not to break the blocks inside, you must abide by that rule.

This also includes **Land Trapping**:
- You cannot claim land that fully encompasses another player's land.
- You cannot claim land that encroaches too close to another player's land boundary without their permission.
  
The server is large enough to accommodate everyone's builds, so **do not crowd other players out of spite**.

### 9.3 - Alternate Account Land Claiming

Using an **alternate account** to claim additional chunks near your main account’s land is strictly prohibited. If you intend to create a Land with an alternate account, it must be located at least **1,000 blocks away** from your main account's Land.

- Sharing memberships of Lands between accounts you own is not allowed unless the account does not own a Land.
- If you have three or more alternate accounts, ensure that you do not have membership in multiple Lands simultaneously.
- The Lands claimed by different accounts must remain separate and should not share items, money, or farms.

If you wish to expand your main account’s Land to an area outside of your Land, consider purchasing a **Land Part** from the **Swyft Coin Shop**.
