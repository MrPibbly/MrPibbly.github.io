## 6 - Evading

If you are punished on our server, **you must wait out your punishment** or submit an appeal via our Discord.

> Use the **Appeals Ticket** in our Discord server to appeal if you believe your punishment is unfair. Appeals are reviewed by the **Player Support Team** and/or **Senior Staff**.

### 6.1 - Mute Evading

If you are muted:

- You **cannot** use an **alternate account** or **any indirect method** (e.g., signs, books, Discord text) to bypass the mute.
- You **may** still communicate with friends via **DMs on Discord** or **other external social platforms**, but not in any way that circumvents the mute on **Minecraft or Discord servers**.

---

### 6.2 - Ban Evading

If you are banned:

- You **cannot access** the Minecraft server or Discord server **in any form**.
- The only exception is using the **Ban Appeal Ticket** in Discord to request a review of your punishment.

> Attempting to evade a mute or ban will **result in harsher penalties.**
