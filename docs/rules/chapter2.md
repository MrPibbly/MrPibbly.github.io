## 2 - PvP Rules

Our PvP rules are simple and straightforward. The **main survival world** is the only world where PvP can be toggled on or off. **Dungeons** do not allow PvP. **All other worlds have PvP always enabled**. Stay safe out there!

---

### 2.1 - PvP Bypass

The following actions are considered PvP bypassing and are not allowed:

- **Break AFK** – Using any method to remove another player’s AFK status.
- **Lands PvP** – PvP is disabled by default in Lands. Using this as an advantage is considered bypassing.
- **PvP Off Exploits** – Killing a player who has PvP turned off by using workarounds or unintended methods.

### 2.2 - Trapping

Trapping players to gain an advantage in PvP is not allowed. This includes:

- **Teleport Trapping** – Inviting a player to teleport only to trap them.
- **Portal Trapping** – Blocking both sides of a portal to trap players entering or exiting.

---

### 2.3 - Unsafe Teleports

Creating warps or accepting teleport requests in a way that is unsafe, harmful, or intended to kill another player is prohibited. This includes:

- Traps
- Falling hazards
- Lava or fire placement
- Withholding escape routes

Unfair PvP wins through teleport manipulation are strictly against the rules.

### 2.4 - Combat Logging

Leaving the server during PvP will:

- **Automatically kill your character**
- **Drop all your items**

> ⚠️ Do **not** engage in PvP close to server restarts. Restarts are announced well in advance. Make sure you're in a **PvP-safe zone** before they happen — **items will not be restored** for combat-related deaths during a restart.
