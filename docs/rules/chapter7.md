## 7 - Conduct Outside of Server

While we generally do not regulate activities **outside of the server**, we **expect respect** to be maintained for all Swyft players, particularly in **direct messages**.

- **Harassment** or **attacks** on another player via **DMs** is not allowed.
- If you encounter a **serious or legitimate issue** with another player outside of the server, please **open a ticket** for review by a staff member.

> Keep interactions respectful and use the serverâ€™s channels for addressing any issues you have.
