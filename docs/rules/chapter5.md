## 5 - Alt Accounts

Players are welcome to use **as many alternate accounts (alts)** as they’d like. However, **certain restrictions are in place to ensure fair gameplay** and prevent abuse.

> Refer to `9.3 - Alternate Account Land Claiming` for rules on land claiming with alt accounts.

### 5.1 - Farming

To prevent **economic exploitation**, alt accounts **cannot be used** to farm:

- Items  
- Experience  
- In-game currency  

for the purpose of **boosting a main account**.

Alt accounts must be treated as **independent players**, not tools to gain an unfair advantage.

> You are allowed to play on an alt account as long as it behaves like a separate, legitimate player—not as a booster for your main.
